This is CALCULATOR for CS50:

    DESCRIPTION:
        A fully moderation graphical calculator written in Python;


    How it works:
        First of all, I have imported the Tkinter library and created the window;
        Secondly, I defined the numbers and operations (+,-,x,%,etc.);
        Lastly, I added all the numbers and operations to graphicall buttons on my window;
        One thing I have added to my "Professional" Calculator is Vectors!!! so when you click on the
        Vectors section on Calculator, it opens a new window containing a big graph. You can give the coordinations for
        2 vectors and it shows you back on the graph the sum of the 2 vectors.



    REQUIREMENTS:
        Python V.3;
        TKINTER and TURTLE libraries;
        some pieces of paper and pen :D
